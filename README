GraphLib, Version 1.3

Library to create, manipulate, and export graphs

Martin Schulz, LLNL, 2005-2007
Additions made by Dorian Arnold (summer 2006)


This library is used in several LLNL projects, including STAT
(a stacktrace analysis tool for scalable debugging) and some
modules in P^nMPI (a tool MPI tool infrastructure). It can
also be used standalone for creating and manipulating graphs,
but its API is primarily tuned to support these other
projects.


A) Compilation

- Untar archive
- set environment variable PROJECTS to the graphlib directory
- Adjust common/Makefile.common to match local system
- Run "make" in graphlib directory

This will create liblnlgraph.a, a demo program called 
"graphdemo", and small utility called "grmerge". 

Running graphdemo will test the most common routines and 
create a set of graphs in DOT and GML format that can then 
be viewed using external tools (e.g., dotty or yed).

grmerge merges an arbitrary number of graphs stored in GraphLib's
internal format and then either saves the merged graph or exports 
it as GML or DOT files. For more information run "grmerge" without 
arguments.


B) INSTALLATION (optional)

To install GraphLib into a common directory, set the environment
variable LOCAL to the intended destination directory (e.g.,
/usr/local). After that run "make install".


C) Usage

- include "graphlib.h" into source code
- link with -llnlgraph

The API is described in the header file.
